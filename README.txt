This Jolly Banking program will take in a file name and assuming it has the correct syntax, will read from the file to create different transactions within the Bank system.

To use the program, run the executable file, a.out, in a linux command line followed up by the path/directory of your file with the file name.
For example: ./a.out Users/Desktop/BankTransIn.txt 

The program will then finish by outputting the transaction history if requested and the final fund amounts of each client created in the Bank system to the output console.
